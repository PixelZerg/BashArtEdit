# BashArtEdit
A ascii art editor, fully compatible with bash's 256 colour system - can export and import bash scripts.

Here's what a typical string properly escaped for 256 colour in the terminal would look like:
```
\e[0m\e[38;5;6mHello \e[38;5;1mE\e[38;5;2mv\e[38;5;3me\e[38;5;4mr\e[38;5;5my\e[38;5;6mo\e[38;5;200mn\e[38;5;226me\e[38;5;231m!
```

Well guess, what, you can directly copy and paste this code into the program and it will be rendered - no hassle - no alterations needed:<br>![demonstration](https://i.gyazo.com/a0505ed3dc72be1e56c3f2a194c9226c.gif)

You can even import huge strings with large amounts of colouring with absolutely no hassle (this string was made with the program, by the way):<br>![demonstration](https://cdn.pbrd.co/images/1g6MsPlY.gif)
